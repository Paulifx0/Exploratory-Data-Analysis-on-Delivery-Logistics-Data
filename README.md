# 📦 Delivery Logistics Data Analysis — EDA & Case Study  
### By Paul | Data Analyst (Beginner Level)

This project is an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a logistics dataset containing **25,000 delivery records**.  
The goal is to uncover insights that help improve delivery operations, optimize costs, and understand customer behavior.

## Project Overview

This analysis explores:

- Delivery partner performance  
- Vehicle usage distribution  
- Delivery modes (same-day, express, two-day)  
- Effect of weather and region  
- Cost drivers (distance, package weight)  
- Customer rating behavior  

The project demonstrates beginner-to-intermediate data analytics skills.

## 🧽 Data Cleaning Summary

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Missing values | **0** |
| Duplicates | **0** |
| Incorrect data types | None |
| Outliers | Normal ranges |
| Inconsistencies | None |

The dataset is **clean and ready for analysis**.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Visualizations created:
- Bar charts (delivery partners, vehicle types, delivery modes)  
- Histograms (distance, weight, delivery cost)  
- Scatter plot (distance vs delivery cost)  
- Correlation heatmap  

### Metrics analyzed:
- Distance travelled  
- Package weight  
- Delivery rating  
- Delivery cost  

## ⭐ Key Insights

### 🔥 Cost Drivers
- **Distance** strongly increases delivery cost  
- **Package weight** also increases cost  

### 🚚 Fleet Usage
- Vans & trucks are the most commonly used vehicles  

### ⚡ Delivery Modes
- **Same-day** delivery is the most popular among customers  

### ⭐ Customer Ratings
- Ratings **do not** depend on distance, weight, or cost  
- Ratings depend more on **service experience**  

## 🧠 Business Recommendations

- Optimize long-distance delivery routes  
- Adjust pricing strategy for heavy packages  
- Improve same-day delivery capacity  
- Strengthen rainy-weather operations  
- Monitor high-volume partners more closely  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook
